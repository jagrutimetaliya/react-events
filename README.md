# 18 - Lists and Keys

- A "key" is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.
- keys give the elements a stable identity 
- keys help React identity which items have changed, are added, or are removed 
- Help in efficient update of the user interface 

# 19 - Index as Key Anti-pattern

When to use index as a key 
1. The items in to your list do not have a unique id.
2. The list is a static list and will not change 
3. The list will never be reordered or filtered.
